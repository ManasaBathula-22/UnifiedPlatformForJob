# A Unified Platform For Job-Specific Candidate Screening and Preparation
The contemporary recruitment process is fraught with inefficiencies, burdening recruiters with high-volume, manual screening and leaving candidates without tailored preparation tools for specific roles. To address this, we propose A Unified Platform for Job-Specific Candidate Screening and Preparation, an intelligent system engineered to streamline and enhance the hiring pipeline. Leveraging a MERN stack foundation, the platform integrates sophisticated Generative AI and Natural Language Processing capabilities using LangChain and Transformer models. For candidates, the system offers a semantic resume analyser that provides actionable feedback against job descriptions and a dynamic AI-powered mock interview coach that delivers detailed performance analysis. For recruiters, it presents a holistic dashboard that consolidates these data points, enabling a rapid, data-driven, and more equitable initial screening process. This project aims to create a cohesive ecosystem that bridges the gap between candidate preparation and recruiter evaluation, fostering a more efficient and transparent job market.
